    "\n",
    "**Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Agents course!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, you built a **single agent** that could take action. Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

    "> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n",
    "> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n",

      "OutlineAgent > **Headline:** Supercharge Your Code: How Multi-Agent Systems Are Revolutionizing Software Development\n",
      "\n",
      "**Introduction Hook:** Imagine a team of highly specialized, autonomous coders working tirelessly on your projects, each with their own unique skills and perspectives. This isn't science fiction anymore. Multi-agent systems (MAS) are no longer just a research concept; they're rapidly becoming a powerful tool for software developers, offering unprecedented levels of efficiency, innovation, and problem-solving capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Main Sections:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Enhanced Problem Solving & Complexity Management**\n",
      "    *   **Divide and Conquer:** MAS excel at breaking down large, complex software problems into smaller, manageable sub-tasks that can be handled by individual agents with specialized expertise.\n",
      "    *   **Distributed Intelligence:** Instead of a single monolithic solution, MAS leverage the collective intelligence of multiple agents, allowing for more robust and adaptable approaches to intricate challenges.\n",
      "    *   **Fault Tolerance & Resilience:** If one agent encounters an issue, others can often compensate, leading to more resilient and fault-tolerant software systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Accelerated Development Cycles & Increased Efficiency**\n",
      "    *   **Parallel Processing Power:** Agents can work concurrently on different aspects of a project, significantly speeding up development timelines compared to traditional sequential approaches.\n",
      "    *   **Automated Task Execution:** Repetitive or time-consuming tasks like testing, code generation, or data analysis can be delegated to dedicated agents, freeing up human developers for higher-level strategic work.\n",
      "    *   **Improved Resource Utilization:** MAS can dynamically allocate tasks and resources to agents based on availability and expertise, optimizing overall development efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Fostering Innovation & Novel Solutions**\n",
      "    *   **Exploration of Diverse Strategies:** Different agents can employ varied algorithms and approaches to solve the same problem, leading to the discovery of novel and optimized solutions that might not be apparent to a single developer.\n",
      "    *   **Emergent Behavior & Creativity:** The interaction between multiple agents can lead to emergent behaviors and creative solutions that are more than the sum of their individual parts.\n",
      "    *   **Simulating Complex Scenarios:** MAS can be used to build sophisticated simulations for testing and validating software in complex, real-world scenarios, driving innovation through experimentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Concluding Thought:** As software projects grow in complexity and the demand for faster development cycles intensifies, multi-agent systems offer a compelling paradigm shift. By embracing the power of distributed intelligence and autonomous agents, developers can unlock new levels of productivity, tackle previously insurmountable challenges, and ultimately build more intelligent and effective software than ever before. The future of software development is collaborative, distributed, and agent-driven.\n",
      "WriterAgent > ## Supercharge Your Code: How Multi-Agent Systems Are Revolutionizing Software Development\n",

      "Imagine a team of highly specialized, autonomous coders working tirelessly on your projects, each with their own unique skills. This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of multi-agent systems (MAS). No longer confined to research labs, MAS are rapidly becoming a powerful tool for developers, offering unprecedented efficiency and innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key benefits is **enhanced problem-solving**. MAS excel at breaking down complex challenges into smaller, manageable tasks, distributing the workload among agents with specialized expertise. This \"divide and conquer\" approach, combined with distributed intelligence, leads to more robust and adaptable solutions. Plus, with built-in fault tolerance, if one agent stumbles, others can often pick up the slack, ensuring system resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "This distributed power also **accelerates development cycles**. Agents can work concurrently, dramatically speeding up timelines. Think of them as automating repetitive tasks like testing or code generation, freeing up human developers for more strategic, creative work. MAS optimizes resource utilization, dynamically allocating tasks for peak efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond speed, MAS **foster innovation**. Different agents can explore diverse problem-solving strategies, uncovering novel solutions that might elude a single developer. The interaction between agents can even lead to emergent, creative outcomes. Furthermore, MAS can build sophisticated simulations for rigorous testing, driving innovation through experimentation.\n",

This is no longer a figment of science fiction; it's the emerging reality of multi-agent systems (MAS). Once confined to research labs, MAS are rapidly transforming into potent tools for developers, ushering in an era of unprecedented efficiency and innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most significant advantages MAS offer is **enhanced problem-solving**. These systems excel at deconstructing complex challenges into smaller, more manageable tasks. This workload can then be distributed among agents, each leveraging their specialized expertise. This \"divide and conquer\" strategy, coupled with distributed intelligence, results in more robust and adaptable solutions. Furthermore, MAS inherently possess fault tolerance; if one agent encounters an issue, others can often compensate, ensuring system resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "This distributed power also dramatically **accelerates development cycles**. With agents capable of working concurrently, project timelines can be significantly compressed. Consider MAS as highly efficient automation for repetitive tasks such as testing, code generation, or data analysis. This delegation frees up human developers to focus on more strategic and creative aspects of software development. MAS also optimize resource utilization by dynamically allocating tasks to agents based on availability and expertise, leading to peak efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond speed and efficiency, MAS actively **foster innovation**. By allowing different agents to explore diverse problem-solving strategies and algorithms, MAS can uncover novel solutions that might not be apparent to a single developer. The dynamic interaction between these agents can even lead to emergent, creative outcomes. Moreover, MAS can construct sophisticated simulations, enabling rigorous testing and driving innovation through comprehensive experimentation.\n",

A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n",

      "InitialWriterAgent > The salt spray stung Elias’s cheeks as he climbed the winding stairs. For thirty years, the lamp had been his world, its beam a solitary conversation with the dark sea. Tonight, however, something felt different. A strange hum vibrated through the stone, and the air smelled of ozone and something like crushed moonlight. In the lamp room, nestled amongst the polished brass and giant lenses, lay a rolled parchment. It wasn't paper; it felt like woven starlight. Unfurling it, Elias gasped. Lines of pure, cool light pulsed across the surface, forming continents he didn't recognize, oceans that shimmered with impossible colors. A single, radiant 'X' marked a spot far from any known shipping lane. The map glowed with its own internal luminescence, a silent invitation to a place beyond the horizon.\n",
      "CriticAgent > This is a strong start to a story, brimming with atmospheric detail and intrigue. Here are a few suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deepen Elias's reaction and internal world:** While Elias gasps, his internal reaction could be expanded. What does this discovery *mean* to him after thirty years of solitude? Is it fear, excitement, disbelief, a yearning for adventure? Showing his immediate thoughts and feelings will make him a more relatable and compelling character. For instance, does he question his sanity? Does a long-forgotten dream resurface?\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Flesh out the \"something different\":** The \"strange hum\" and \"ozone and crushed moonlight\" are excellent sensory details that build mystery. To enhance the plot's momentum, consider hinting at *why* this might be happening now. Is there a celestial event, a change in the sea, or something Elias has done (even unknowingly) that could have triggered this? A slight nudge in this direction could provide a foundation for future events.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Consider the immediate next step:** The story ends with the map's invitation. What is Elias's immediate decision or action? Does he dismiss it, study it further, try to find a source, or feel an undeniable pull? Showing a brief, decisive action will give the ending more impact and propel the reader into wanting to know what happens next. For example, does he reach out to touch the 'X', or does he feel a physical sensation drawing him towards the sea?\n",
      "RefinerAgent > The salt spray stung Elias’s cheeks as he climbed the winding stairs, each step a familiar ache in his thirty-year vigil. The lamp, his solitary companion, had always been a conversation with the dark sea, its beam a predictable rhythm against the crashing waves. But tonight, the rhythm faltered. A low, resonant hum vibrated through the ancient stone, a visceral thrum that unsettled him more than any storm.

      "He found it nestled amongst the polished brass and giant lenses of the lamp room: a rolled parchment. It wasn't paper. It felt cool and strangely yielding, like woven starlight compressed into tangible form. His breath hitched. With trembling fingers, Elias unfurled it. Lines of pure, cool light pulsed across the surface, coalescing into continents he’d never seen, oceans that shimmered with impossible, vibrant colors. A single, radiant 'X' pulsed at its center, an insistent beacon far from any charted waters.\n",

      "Disbelief warred with a sudden, fierce surge of something long dormant within him – a yearning for the unknown that thirty years of solitude had nearly extinguished. *Was he dreaming? Had the isolation finally fractured his mind?* The map glowed with its own internal luminescence, a silent, irresistible invitation. He felt a strange pull, not just from the map, but from the sea itself, as if the ocean's depths were responding to this celestial call. His gaze fixed on the radiant 'X'. For the first time in decades, the horizon didn't represent the limit of his world, but a tantalizing doorway. Hesitantly, Elias reached out, his fingertip hovering just above the pulsating light, a silent promise to an adventure that had just begun.\n",
